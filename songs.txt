If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (you're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (you're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
I'm levitating (woo)
You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah (woo)
My love is like a rocket, watch it blast off
And I'm feeling so electric, dance my ass off
And even if I wanted to, I can't stop
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My love is like a rocket, watch it blast off
And I'm feeling so electric, dance my ass off
And even if I wanted to, I can't stop
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
I got you (yeah), moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night (all night), come on, dance with me
I'm levitating (woo)
You can fly away with me tonight (tonight)
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah (take you for a ride)
I'm levitating (woo)
You can fly away with me tonight (tonight)
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah (let me take you for a ride)
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight (you are my starlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me (come on, dance with me)
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (you're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
Yeah
I saw you dancing in a crowded room
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye
I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away
You could have asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care
I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day
So I made you think that I would always stay
I said some things that I should never say
Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
And now you won't love me for a second time
I don't know why I run away
Oh girl, I make you cry when I run away
Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that I'm much too late
And you deserve someone better
Save your tears for another day (ooh, yeah)
Save your tears for another day (yeah)
I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away
Save your tears for another day, ooh girl (ah)
I said save your tears for another day, yeah (ah)
Save your tears for another day (ah)
Save your tears for another day (ah)
What you know about rollin' down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean, ayy

She say that I'm cool (damn straight)
I'm like "yeah, that's true" (that's true)
I believe in G-O-D (ayy)
Don't believe in T-H-O-T
She keep playing me dumb (play me)
I'ma play her for fun (uh-huh)
Y'all don't really know my mental
Lemme give you the picture like stencil
Falling out, in a drought
No flow, rain wasn't pouring down (pouring down)
See, that pain was all around
See, my mode was kinda lounged
Didn't know which-which way to turn
Flow was cool but I still felt burnt
Energy up, you can feel my surge
I'ma kill everything like this purge (ayy)
Let's just get this straight for a second, I'ma work
Even if I don't get paid for progression, I'ma get it (get it)
Everything that I do is electric
I'ma keep it in a motion, keep it moving like kinetic, ayy (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Put this shit in a frame, better know I don't blame
Everything that I say, man I seen you deflate
Let me elevate, this ain't a prank
Have you walkin' on a plank, la-la-la-la-la, like
Both hands together, God, let me pray (now let me pray)
Uh, I've been going right, right around, call that relay (Masked Wolf)
Pass the baton, back and I'm on
Swimming in the pool, Kendrick Lamar, uh
Want a piece of this, a piece of mine, my peace a sign
Can you please read between the lines?
My rhyme's inclined to break your spine
They say that I'm so fine
You could never match my grind
Please do not, not waste my time
What you know about rollin' down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean, ayy

Ooh
Balloons are deflatin'
Guess they look lifeless like me
We miss you on your side of the bed, mmm
Still got your things here
And they stare at me like souvenirs
Don't wanna let you out my head
Just like the day that I met you
The day I thought forever
Said that you love me
But that'll last for never
It's cold outside
Like when you walked out my life
Why you walked out my life?
I get like this every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
'Cause I remember every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
Do you ever think of me?
No
(Ooh) No-no, no
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) Ooh, nah
I'm buildin' my hopes up
Like presents unopened 'til this day
I still see the messages you read, mmm
I'm foolishly patient
(Foolishly patient)
Can't get past the taste of your lips
(Taste of your lips)
Don't wanna let you out my head
Just like the day that I met you
The day I thought forever
Said that you love me
But that'll last for never
It's cold outside
Like when you walked out my life
Why you walked out my life?
I get like this every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
'Cause I remember every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
Do you ever think of me?
Of me
'Cause I think of you, think of you
Road shimmer
Wiggling the vision
Heat heat waves
I'm swimming in a mirror
Road shimmer
Wiggling the vision
Heat heat waves
I'm swimming in a
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now
Usually I put
Something on TV
So we never think
About you and me
But today I see
Our reflections
Clearly in Hollywood
Laying on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need something I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now the night has come but
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now
You can't fight it
You can't breathe
You say something so loving but
Now I've got to let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now
I just wonder what you're dreaming of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Heat waves been faking me out
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now
Road shimmer
Wiggling the vision
Heat heat waves
I'm swimming in a mirror
Road shimmer
Wiggling the vision
Heat heat waves
I'm swimming in a mirror
Yeah
I've been tryin' to call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (oh)
No one's around to judge me (oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone
And I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
(Hey, hey, hey)
I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh
The city's cold and empty (oh)
No one's around to judge me (oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone
And I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
I'm just walking by to let you know (by to let you know)
I could never say it on the phone (say it on the phone)
Will never let you go this time (ooh)
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
(Hey, hey, hey)
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
You know you can call me if you need someone
I'll pick up the pieces if you come undone
Painting stars up on your ceiling 'cause you
Wish that you could find some feeling, yeah, you
You know you can call me if you need someone
I need you to hold on
Heaven is a place not too far away
We all know I should be the one
To say we all make mistakes (we all make mistakes)
Take my hand and hold on
Tell me everything that you need to say
'Cause I know how it feels to be someone
Feels to be someone who loses their way
You're looking for answers in a place unknown
You need the connection but you can't get close (can't get close)
Painting stars up on your ceiling 'cause you
Wish that you could find some feeling, yeah, you
You know you can call me if you need someone
I need you to hold on (hold on)
Heaven is a place not too far away (away, yeah)
We all know I should be the one
To say we all make mistakes (we all make mistakes)
Take my hand and hold on
Tell me everything that you need to say
'Cause I know how it feels to be someone
Feels to be someone who loses their way
Midnight 'til morning
Call if you need somebody
I will be there for you (I will be there for you)
Midnight 'til morning
Call if you need somebody
I will be there for you
I need you to hold on
Heaven is a place not too far away
We all know I should be the one
To say we all make mistakes (we all make mistakes)
Take my hand and hold on
Tell me everything that you need to say
'Cause I know how it feels to be someone (ooh, yeah)
Feels to be someone who loses their way
Midnight 'til morning
Call if you need somebody
I will be there for you (oh yeah, yeah)
Midnight 'til morning
Call if you need somebody
I will be there for you
It's beautiful, it's bittersweet
You're like a broken home to me
I take a shot of memories
And black out like an empty street
I fill my days with the way you walk
And fill my nights with broken dreams
I make up lies inside my head
Like one day you'll come back to me
Now I'm not holding on, not holding on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holding on, not holding on
Beautiful mistakes, I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back
I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes
Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, eh
Making beautiful mistakes
It's pitiful, I can't believe
How every day gets worse for me
I take a break, I cut you off
To keep myself from looking soft
I fill my nights with the way you was
And still wake up with broken dreams
I make these lies inside my head
Feel like they're my reality
Now I'm not holding on, not holding on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holding on, not holding on
Beautiful mistakes, I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back
I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes
Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, eh
Making beautiful mistakes
You did me wrong 'cause I let you
Usually, I like my situations beneficial
Doing something different, got me looking stupid (Damn)
The only way I'm coming back to you is if you dream it, lucid (Hmm)
Prove it, if you made a promise then keep it (Keep it)
Why you wanna lie and then get mad? I don't believe it (Boy, bye)
But really, I was doing just fine without ya
Looking fine, sipping wine, dancing on club couches (Ah)
Baby, why you wanna lose me like you don't need me? (Like you don't need me)
Like I don't block you and you still try to reach me (Still try to reach me)
How you figure out how to call me from the TV? (Huh?)
You running outta chances and this time I mean it (Ah)
Yeah, bet you miss my love, all in your bed (Bed)
Now you're stressing out, pulling your hair (Hair)
Smelling your pillows and wishing I was there (I was there)
Sliding down the shower wall, looking sad (Sad)
I know it's hard to let go, I'm the best (I'm the best)
Best you ever had and best you gon' get (Gon' get)
And if we break up, I don't wanna be friends (Be friends)
You're toxic
Beautiful mistakes, I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back
I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes
Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, yeah, yeah
Making beautiful mistakes
Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, eh
Making beautiful mistakes
Nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah (Ooh)
Nah-nah-nah
I was listenin' to the ocean
I saw a face in the sand
But when I picked it up
Then it vanished away from my hands, gone
I had a dream I was seven
Climbing my way in a tree
I saw a piece of Heaven
Waiting impatient for me, down
And I was runnin' far away
Would I run off the world someday?
Nobody knows
Nobody knows, and
I was dancing in the rain
I felt alive and I can't complain
But now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I can't take it anymore
I was painting a picture
The picture was a painting of you and
For a moment I thought you were here
But then again, it wasn't true, gone
And all this time I have been lyin'
Oh, lyin' in secret to myself
I've been putting sorrow on the
Farthest place on my shelf
La-di-da
And I was runnin' far away
Would I run off the world someday?
Nobody knows
Nobody knows, and
I was dancing in the rain
I felt alive and I can't complain
But now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
Now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
Now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I can't take it anymore
But I kept runnin'
For a soft place to fall
And I kept runnin'
For a soft place to fall
And I kept runnin'
For a soft place to fall
And I kept runnin'
For a soft place to fall
And I was runnin' far away
Would I run off the world someday?
But now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
Now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
Now take me home
Home where I belong
Oh, no, no
Now take me home
Home where I belong
Ho, ho, ho
Now take me home
Home where I belong
Oh, no, no
Now take me home
Home where I belong
I can't take it anymore
And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach
But I stand in California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh
Oh, she knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no
'Cause it's too cold
For you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue 'cause you love to taste, yeah
These hearts adore, everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour
Coming down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no
'Cause it's too cold
For you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
'Cause it's too cold
For you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
'Cause it's too cold
For you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
It's too cold
For you here
And now, let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
And it's too cold, it's too cold
The hands of my sweater
I don't wanna seem the way I do
But I'm confident when I'm with you
Lately all I feel is bad and bruised
Tired of tripping on my shoes
But when he loves me I feel like I'm floating
When he calls me pretty I feel like somebody
Even when we fade eventually to nothing
You will always be my favorite form of loving
When I start to tumble from the sky
You remind me how to fly
Lately, I've been feeling un-alive
But you bring me back to life
But when he loves me, I feel like I'm floating
When he calls me pretty, I feel like somebody
Even when we fade eventually to nothing
You will always be my favorite form of loving
But when he loves me, I feel like I'm floating
When he calls me pretty, I feel like somebody
Even when we fade eventually to nothing
You will always be my favorite form of loving
